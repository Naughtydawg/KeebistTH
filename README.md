# TheKeebist
A low profile 6x16, 85key Ortholinear keyboard using Elite-C with 2u modifiers, a split space bar and 1.25u system keys. Built with Keeb.io libraries.    WARNING: this is a completely untested design, do not download this with the expectation it will actually work if you print it.

There are led footprints, but do not be fooled, there is no built in LED support yet.

Required materials to finish : 1 Elite-C pro micro, 1 reset switch (probably unnecessary), 85 1N4148 Diodes, 85 kailh choc switches, 18 m2 5mm countersunk screws, 9 m2 6mm spacers, and an acryllic base to mount it all on (in development). unfortunately you have to buy two sets of keycaps to get enough 1.25 keys, but then you can mix and match the only two(black&white).

The pcb measures 310x119mm.

Stuff I want to add:

smt parts placement

lights

rotary encoder

an onboard controller
