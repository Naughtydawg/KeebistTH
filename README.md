KEEBISTLIGHT IS NOT CONFIRMED TO WORK but at least it has MX compatibility

A low profile 6x16, 85key Ortholinear keyboard using Elite-C with 2u modifiers, a split space bar and 1.25u system keys. Built with Keeb.io libraries.  It lives!

There are led footprints, but do not be fooled, there is no built in LED support yet.

Required materials to finish : 1 Elite-C pro micro, 1 reset switch (probably unnecessary), 85 1N4148 Diodes, 85 switches (First version is KAILH CHOC ONLY), 18 m2 screws, 9 m2 8mm spacers(6mm if you take the plastic off the elite c pins), and an acryllic base to mount it all on. unfortunately you have to buy two sets of keycaps to get enough 1.25 keys, but then you can mix and match the only two(black&white).

Diodes are alligned with the line towards the square pad.

The pcb measures 310x119mm.

Stuff I want to add:

rotary encoder

an onboard controller

a full 15x6 grid

support for 5.25u space
